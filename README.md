# Snake-And-Ladder-ASM-Project
Move your counter forward the number of spaces shown on the dice. If your counter lands at the bottom of a ladder, you can move up to the top of the ladder. If your counter lands on the head of a snake, you must slide down to the bottom of the snake. The first player to get to the space that says 'home' is the winner.
